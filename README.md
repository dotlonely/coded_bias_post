Lessons from Coded Bias and the Ethics of AI
The documentary Coded Bias shines a critical light on the hidden dangers of artificial intelligence, focusing on biases embedded in technologies like facial recognition. An MIT researcher discovered that facial recognition systems failed to identify her face unless she wore a white mask. This shocking revelation highlights how biased datasets often disadvantage women and people of color, perpetuating inequality.
The film explores how biased algorithms affect critical areas like housing, education, employment, and policing. For example, facial recognition inaccuracies have led to wrongful arrests, disproportionately impacting marginalized groups. These biases stem from flawed training data and a lack of diverse perspectives among developers.
A central theme of Coded Bias is the absence of legal frameworks to govern AI. Algorithms increasingly influence decisions without transparency or accountability, reinforcing systemic discrimination under the mask of objectivity. A testimony before Congress emphasized the urgent need for oversight and fairness in AI development.
The documentary explains that AI is not inherently neutral, and reflects the biases of its creators and data. Addressing these issues requires diverse teams, robust data governance, and regulatory frameworks. 
Coded Bias serves as a call to action, urging society to prioritize ethical AI development to ensure that these powerful technologies benefit everyone equally.
